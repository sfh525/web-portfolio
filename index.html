        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there, welcome to my website!<br/> <br/>

                My name is Salman Faiz Hidayat, but you can call me Faiz. I am an undergraduate computer science 
                student in Gadjah Mada University. <br/> <br/>

                I am passionate in continuous learning in the field of software engineering and 
                artificial intelligence. In fact, this website is my way of practicing software engineering! 
                You can also see my AI models that I've built in the past in my github, which I will link in this 
                website :) <br/> <br/>

                Outside of technical skills, I am an avid leader, who can coordinate works and talents in a team or organization. 
                I also work great with people, mainly by the virtue of listening to others more than talking. 
            </p>
